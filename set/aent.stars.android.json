[[{"value": "<h1 class=\"entry-title\">Privacy Policy</h1>", "level": 9}, {"value": "<div class=\"container\" id=\"content-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"entry-content\" id=\"content\">\n<p><strong>Privacy Policy of Netzari Press</strong><br/>\nYour privacy is important to Netzari Press. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. \u00c2\u00a0Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong><br/>\nPersonal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<br/>\nYou may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Netzari Press or an Netzari Press affiliated company. Netzari Press and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have. \u00c2\u00a0Here are some examples of the types of personal information Netzari Press may collect and how we may use it.</p>\n<p><strong>What personal information we collect</strong><br/>\nWhen you create an Netzari Press ID, purchase a product, download a software update, sign up as an affiliate, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, PayPal email and/or credit card information.<br/>\nWhen you share your content with family and friends using Netzari Press products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Netzari Press services or forums, Netzari Press may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Netzari Press will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>How we use your personal information</strong><br/>\nThe personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Netzari Press\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.\u00c2\u00a0We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\u00c2\u00a0We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Netzari Press ID account holders. \u00c2\u00a0From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Netzari Press, you may not opt out of receiving these communications. \u00c2\u00a0We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Netzari Press\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products, services, and customer communications. \u00c2\u00a0If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</strong><br/>\nWe also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it: \u00c2\u00a0We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where a Netzari Press product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<br/>\nWe may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iTunes Store, Google Play, and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Cookies and Other Technologies</strong><br/>\nNetzari Press\u00e2\u0080\u0099s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \u00e2\u0080\u009ccookies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. You always have the option to turn off the cookie function of your internet browser. \u00c2\u00a0Netzari Press and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Netzari Press more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Netzari Press Online Store. Knowing your country and language \u00e2\u0088\u0092 and if you are an educator, your school \u00e2\u0088\u0092 helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service. \u00c2\u00a0In some of our email messages, we use a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclick-through URL\u00e2\u0080\u009d linked to content on the Netzari Press website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. \u00c2\u00a0Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure to Third Parties</strong><br/>\nPersonal information will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br/>\nNetzari Press shares personal information with companies who provide services such as fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Netzari Press operates.</p>\n<p><strong>Others</strong><br/>\nIt may be necessary \u00e2\u0088\u0092 by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence \u00e2\u0088\u0092 for Netzari Press to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection of Personal Information</strong><br/>\nNetzari Press takes the security of your personal information very seriously. Netzari Press online services such as the Netzari Press Online Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as SSL security. When your personal data is stored by Netzari Press, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures. Cloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third party storage. \u00c2\u00a0When you use some Netzari Press products, services, or applications or post on a Netzari Press forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</strong><br/>\nNetzari Press makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p><strong>Access to Personal Information</strong><br/>\nYou can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account. For other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Netzari Press is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made through the regional Privacy Contact Form.</p>\n<p><strong>Children</strong><br/>\nWe understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Netzari Press products and services. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, without verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, without first receiving verifiable parental consent we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Netzari Press IDs, unless their parent provided consent through the Netzari Press ID for Students Program or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing. For example, a parent must review the Netzari Press ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Netzari Press\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Information; and the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Netzari Press ID account creation process for their child. Learn more about Family Sharing, the Netzari Press ID for Students program and Restrictions for children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounts. If at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Netzari Press ID, they may contact us through our Contact Form.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-Party Sites and Services</strong><br/>\nNetzari Press websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties \u00e2\u0088\u0092 for example, a third-party iPhone app, publication, software, video or other printed or electronic product. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>\n<p><strong>International Users</strong><br/>\nAll the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Netzari Press abides by the \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe harbor\u00e2\u0080\u009d frameworks set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection of personal information.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy</strong><br/>\nTo make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Netzari Press employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy Questions</strong><br/>\nIf you have any questions or concerns about Netzari Press\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Privacy Policy or data processing or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please contact us. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances. Netzari Press may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Shalom U\u2019Vrachot,</p>\n<p>Chaya Miryam, VP Marketing</p>\n</div><!-- #content -->\n</div>", "level": 0}, {"value": "<footer class=\"smpadding\" id=\"footer\">\n<div class=\"textwidget\"><p>Please refrain from purchases on Biblical Holy Days</p>\n<p>Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2018 \u2013 Netzari Press, All Rights Reserved.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"textwidget\"><a href=\"https://www.aent.org/follow-us/\">Follow Us</a>  \u00a0\u00a0| \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.aent.org/help-returns-refunds/\">Help: Returns &amp; Refunds</a> \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0  <a href=\"https://www.aent.org/privacy-policy/\">Privacy Policy</a></div>\n</footer>", "level": 0}, {"value": "<style type=\"text/css\">#sfsi_plus_floater { margin-top:120px;margin-left:0px; }</style>", "level": 0}, {"value": "<div class=\"sfsiplus_norm_row sfsi_plus_wDiv\" id=\"sfsi_plus_floater\" style=\"z-index: 9999;width:48px;text-align:left;position:absolute;position:absolute;left:10px;top:2%\"><div class=\"sfsi_plus_wicons shuffeldiv cmcls\" style=\"width:40px; height:40px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:30px;\"><div class=\"sfsiplus_inerCnt\"><a class=\" sficn\" effect=\"scale\" href=\"https://www.aent.org/sendy/subscription?f=xvZL80m763XJnHkzO19sV2KXnh9DkDTeBMkyDQ0d5IZjqjWZS4892ctwtWtU2B763RUW9892yvZ1BVwvojzJxI2m8aLtRQ\" id=\"sfsiplusid_custom\" style=\"opacity:1\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Subscribe Newsletter\" class=\"sfcm sfsi_wicon\" effect=\"scale\" height=\"40\" src=\"https://www.aent.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/plus_custom_icon0.jpg\" style=\"\" title=\"Subscribe Newsletter\" width=\"40\"/></a></div></div><div class=\"sfsi_plus_wicons shuffeldiv \" style=\"width:40px; height:40px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:30px;\"><div class=\"sfsiplus_inerCnt\"><a class=\" sficn\" effect=\"scale\" href=\"http://www.specificfeeds.com/widgets/emailSubscribeEncFeed/WUdEaENiQkc1b0pkVTFvTG4rcFdmYVRhRGk5YUtRVWQ3MkE4K01hdC8rQlFOVS9Ua0p0SE4zdUtTZ05wOVlLNTVSTkxiOVdhNHNGY0VVUmd6VlJ6dFB5RC9BbEkxbWR4U3hrWWxVN0dJR2NBTloyZThpRlF6R0lqWUhZN3Ayam58K2FCUE9MS1l2bzBhY0FwWWRnSjh6ZmNpU052WkxtTWV1VERWR1hGcGFLbz0=/OA==/\" id=\"sfsiplusid_email\" style=\"opacity:1\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Contact Us\" class=\"sfcm sfsi_wicon\" effect=\"scale\" height=\"40\" src=\"https://www.aent.org/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/images/icons_theme/default/default_email.png\" style=\"\" title=\"Contact Us\" width=\"40\"/></a><span class=\"bot_no \">30k</span></div></div><div class=\"sfsi_plus_wicons shuffeldiv \" style=\"width:40px; height:40px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:30px;\"><div class=\"sfsiplus_inerCnt\"><a class=\" sficn\" effect=\"scale\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Aramaic-English-New-Testament-100459528210/\" id=\"sfsiplusid_facebook\" style=\"opacity:1\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" class=\"sfcm sfsi_wicon\" effect=\"scale\" height=\"40\" src=\"https://www.aent.org/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/images/icons_theme/default/default_fb.png\" style=\"\" title=\"Facebook\" width=\"40\"/></a><div class=\"sfsi_plus_tool_tip_2 sfsi_plus_fb_tool_bdr sfsi_plus_Tlleft\" id=\"sfsiplusid_facebook\" style=\"width:62px ;opacity:0;z-index:-1;\"><span class=\"bot_arow bot_fb_arow\"></span><div class=\"sfsi_plus_inside\"><div class=\"icon1\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Aramaic-English-New-Testament-100459528210/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" src=\"https://www.aent.org/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-plus/images/visit_icons/Visit_us_fb/icon_Visit_us_en_US.png\" title=\"Facebook\"/></a></div><div class=\"icon2\"><fb:like action=\"like\" href=\"https://www.aent.org/privacy-policy\" layout=\"button\" send=\"false\" showfaces=\"false\" width=\"180\"></fb:like></div><div class=\"icon3\"><fb:share-button href=\"https://www.aent.org/privacy-policy\" type=\"button\" width=\"140\"></fb:share-button></div></div></div></div></div></div>", "level": 0}]]
