We reserve the right to make changes to it and publish the latest version which shall then apply.</p>\n<p><em>Information you share with us</em></p>\n<p>We do not require you to directly provide any personal information to us to start using our services. It is not necessary for you to have created an account (although you may choose to do so), nor will we ever make your use of our apps public, other than occasionally quoting user reviews posted in app stores on our website or in other publicity.</p>\n<p>If you do choose to create an account with us (where available), you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide the additional services linked to registration to you. This includes an email address and password. We use this information to authenticate your account only and will keep it secure.</p>\n<p>In addition, should you contact us directly (either via the app, website or a direct email) you will be providing your name, email address and (when contacting us from the app) an app ID. We will keep the content of your message and contact information to enable us to respond to your request.</p>\n<p>If using our myTrains service you will need to provide us with payment information, including your debit or credit card number, card expiration date, CVV code and billing address, in order to purchase train tickets. We will never require that you provide payment information for any other services, all IAPs or the purchase of Pro versions of our apps is transacted via the appropriate app store and we never receive payment information about you from them.</p>\n<p><em>Additional information we receive about you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all users</em></p>\n<p><em>Location information:</em> We require information about your current location to effectively offer you our services.

If you choose not to share location, we will be unable to offer you our full level of intended service which relies on this data.</p>\n<p><em>Cookies:</em> Our website uses cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.

For example, when you open the app we record this as a session so we can monitor which of our apps are being used most often, at what times of the day, etc; if the app crashes we log the screen you were viewing and other data such as if you have mobile reception to help us identify the cause of such crashes and fix them. This information is collected by third-party SDKs (as identified later in this Policy) and we receive anonymised reports from this data to help us enhance our services.</p>\n<p><em>Apple music services:</em> The Playlists feature in our Bus Times London app makes use of MusicKit on iOS 11 and above. This feature requires access to Apple Music, your music and video activity and your media library so that we can provide you with personalised playlists to listen to on your journey. Granting this permission is necessary for the Playlists feature to work. We will never access your music for any other reason and will never access your non-music media (such as video or photos). In addition, we will never analyse or store your music preferences. This permission can be revoked at any time through your device settings.</p>\n<p><em>Additional information we receive about you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 certain users</em></p>\n<p>The additional information we receive about you depends on whether you have purchased a Pro version or the \u00e2\u0080\u009cremove ads\u00e2\u0080\u009d (or equivalent) IAP.

We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads within the app and outside of it. Our ad partners and affiliates collect information such as advertising IDs and location. In some instances, we collect this ourselves and provide it to our partners but in many cases, especially with our ad partners, they collect the data via SDKs and this is not shared with us.</p>\n<p><em>Information we share and disclose</em></p>\n<p><em>Payment information:</em> If using myTrains we share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.</p>\n<p><em>Service providers:</em> We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help us understand the use of our services, such as Flurry Analytics and Google Analytics. We may share your personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>\n<p><em>Law, Harm, and the Public Interest:</em> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, or disclose your personal data if we believe that it is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platforms; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services.

This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity.</p>\n<p><em>Non-Personal Information:</em> We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of downloads, monthly active users or sessions, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their ads.</p>\n<p><em>Advertisers and data partners:</em> If you have not purchased a Pro version of the app or made the \u00e2\u0080\u009cremove ads\u00e2\u0080\u009d IAP then we may provide to third party advertising and data partners information about your activity on our app and your location.

If you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.</p>\n<p>Your rights under GDPR are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have the right to be informed about our processing of your personal data;</li>\n<li>You have the right to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate and to have incomplete personal data completed;</li>\n<li>You have the right to object to us processing your personal data;</li>\n<li>You have the right to have your personal data erased, otherwise known as the \u00e2\u0080\u0098right to be forgotten\u00e2\u0080\u0099;</li>\n<li>You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you, and information on how we process it, commonly known as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098data subject access request\u00e2\u0080\u0099;</li>\n<li>You have the right to move, copy or transfer your personal data (\u00e2\u0080\u0098data portability\u00e2\u0080\u0099); and</li>\n<li>You have rights in relation to automated decision making, including profiling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office.

In doing so you will still receive adverts, but they will be less relevant to you (and so probably more of an annoyance) as less information is made available to the advertisers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analytics data: We use this data anonymously to help us improve and fix bugs within our apps. You can remove this from the settings in your device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location data: We need this data to provide our full services.

Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your data in the United Kingdom, and any other country where we operate. In some of the countries to which we transfer personal data, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those of your country.</p>\n<p>If we transfer personal data outside of the European Union or EFTA States, we will ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects based on the adequacy of the receiving country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data protection laws and contractual obligations placed on the recipient of the data.
