Please read them carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Using our Products</b><br/>\n<br/>\nYou must follow any policies made available to you within the Products.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon\u2019t misuse our Products. For example, don\u2019t interfere with our Products or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Products only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Products to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing our Products does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Products or the content you access.

Don\u2019t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Products.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Products display some content that is not Papers Apps LABS\u2019s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don\u2019t assume that we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn connection with your use of the Products, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.<br/>\nSome of our Products are available on mobile devices.

You should look at the terms regularly. We\u2019ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Product or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Product, you should discontinue your use of that Product.<br/>\nIf there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese terms control the relationship between Papers Apps LABS and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not comply with these terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, this doesn\u2019t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).<br/>\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.<br/>\nThe laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California\u2019s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Products. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Products will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Papers Apps LABS consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.<br/>\n<div>\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>", "level": 0}, {"value": "<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div
