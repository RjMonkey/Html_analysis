<p>If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our privacy statement or policies, please suporte@iddesenvolvimento.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></h3>
<p>BY INSTALLING THE APPS ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, ENTERING INTO, CONNECTING TO, ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE APPS, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, INCLUDING TO THE POSSIBLE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ON YOUR DEVICE. PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU OR, AS APPLICABLE, YOUR LEGAL GUARDIAN, DISAGREE TO ANY TERM PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL, ACCESS AND/OR USE THE APPS AND YOU ARE REQUESTED TO PROMPTLY ERASE THEM, AND ANY PART THEREOF, FROM YOUR MOBILE DEVICE.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></h3>
<p>If you are under the age of eighteen (18) you hereby represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3><strong>Information We Collect</strong></h3>
<p>We may collect through the Services both personal information that identifies you and can be used to contact you, and non-personal information, which is data in a form that does not allow direct association with you, which may include technical information, including the IP address through which you are accessing the Services and the unique mobile device ID or virtual unique device identifier for any mobile device you may be using.</p>
<ol>

<p>Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, e-mail address, date of birth, and any personal photo or image representation. We will collect, use and disclose personal information only as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that some non-personal information would be considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other information in a way that enables you to be identified, but the same information is considered non-personal information when taken alone or combined only with other non-personal information.</p>
<ol>

<ul>
<li>To send important notices, such as communications about your purchases and changes to this Privacy Policy;</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>To inform you about new ID Desenvolvimento products and promote ID Desenvolvimento products;</li>
<li>To send "push" notifications to your mobile device regarding ID Desenvolvimento Games that you have been playing (for example, suggesting that you open the ID Desenvolvimento Games to take certain actions);</li>

</ol>
<p>If we send e-mail or SMS messages to you for the purpose of promoting ID Desenvolvimento products or services, or those of a third-party partner, we will generally provide you with choices about receiving further such promotional messages. Preferences for "push" notifications may in most cases be adjusted through ID Desenvolvimento Games or your mobile device.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction with Game Center or Other 3rd Party Game Services </strong></p>
<p>By registering with your Game Center on your device (“Game Center”), you allow ID Desenvolvimento to access certain information from your profile for that Game Center.

<li>The login e-mail you provided to that Game Center when you registered; and</li>
<li>Your gender.</li>
</ol>
<p>By connecting any ID Desenvolvimento Game to a Game Center, you consent to our access, use and storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy of any and all of the information that you agreed the Game Center could provide to ID Desenvolvimento Games.
