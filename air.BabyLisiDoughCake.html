                    <p>Baby Lisi Games Privacy Policy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY If you have any privacy related concerns, please contact us at: babylisigames(at)gmail.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Baby Lisi Games</strong><strong> is a trademark who offers entertaining mobile applications (&lsquo;&rsquo;App/s&rsquo;&rsquo;). This privacy statement describes how </strong><strong>Baby Lisi Games</strong><strong> collects and uses the information and/or data (the terms are used interchangeably) you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your information and how you can access the information. We respect your privacy and we take protecting it seriously.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOUR CONSENT With downloading of our App, you consent to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read carefully this Privacy Policy. By downloading and using our apps, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent with the collection, use and disclosure of your Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION In order for you to be able to use our App, we need to collect some Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-personal Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We and our Providers collect anonymous information by which users cannot be directly or indirectly identified (&lsquo;&rsquo;Non-Personal Information&rsquo;&rsquo;). Non-Personal Information may include various technical information, such as information about your device, your browser type, screen resolution, device type, language, version and type of operating system, mobile phone carrier, network provider, network status, SDK version, browser cookies, API key, application version, Android or iOS Vendor, Flash version, geo location (not specific enough to identify a city or town), storage size, screen size, firmware, aggregated data log files from servers, session information, levels achieved, in-app purchases, advertisement response (including clicks on ads, if it originated a follow-up action to a third party e.g, &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; event), which advertisements are shown, the date and time a particular ad is served, angle view, information about the advertisements reviewed by the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect and we allow our Providers to collect some of these personal information through which you can be indirectly identified, such as: IP address, advertising identifier (IDFAs - iOS, IDFVs, Advertising ID - Android), geo-location data (specific enough to identify a town and state), raw data log files on servers (IP address, date, time, requests, state etc.), the activities of the user in our App (characteristics obtained by your use, such as data about Apps you used, any actions or movements within the Apps, date and time, response times, download errors, length of visits, interaction information such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs, what tools in the Apps the user uses, user&rsquo;s interaction with the service and user&rsquo;s behavior on the service), player identifier string when using game center and push tokens (&lsquo;&rsquo;Personal Information&rsquo;&rsquo;). Our Advertising Providers collect data regarding advertisement performance, user&rsquo;s interaction with ads, our Apps and user&rsquo;s interests. The Information is used only for limited purposes as stated in Section &lsquo;&rsquo;Usage of Information&rsquo;&rsquo; taking into account the limitations regarding collection and usage of certain Information in Section &lsquo;&rsquo;Children&rsquo;s Information Collection&rsquo;&rsquo;. Non-personal Information and Personal Information is commonly referred to as the &lsquo;&rsquo;Information&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>
<p>CHILDREN&rsquo;S INFORMATION COLLECTION</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on offering entertaining Apps for family audience of all ages. Because we want your child to use our Apps in a safe environment, we have limited the collection and usage of the collected Information for Apps that are directed to children. We have also integrated an age gate in order to limit the collection and usage of Information for users under the age of 13 in specific territories (US included) for the mixed audience Apps.</p>
<p>The age gate is being conducted after the download of some of our Apps for specific territories in order to assure the privacy and protection of younger users of our apps. If you do not pass the age gate the features enabling potential collection and sharing of personally identifiable information such as game center feature and interaction with third party social networks or platforms are disabled for your device ID. For your safety, it is not possible to change your age later on. We do not store your year of birth, but only the information whether your device ID passed the age gate or not.</p>
<p>We also limit the Provider&rsquo;s usage of Information collected from users of child directed or mixed audience Apps that do not pass the age gate. Our Advertising Providers are allowed to show you contextual ads, but are prohibited from conducting behavioral advertising, profiling or contacting you in any other way.</p>
<p>USAGE OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>We use the Information we collect with the help of our Analytics Providers to constantly improve our Apps and make them better for you, as well as to display advertisements with our Advertising Providers which enables us to offer some of our apps to you for free. We chose our Providers carefully and request their compliance with valid legislation.</p>
<p>We and our Analytics Providers use the Non-Personal Information to understand and optimize how our Apps are used, improve our marketing efforts, provide our content and features that are of interest to you, for statistics, analytics, research and development in order to continuously improve our apps and make them better for you. This includes correcting technical malfunctions, customization, providing better and improved content, developing new offers, measuring traffic and usage of our apps, promoting the apps and improving the user experience. We use aggregated and anonymized data log files and the activities of the user within our apps for internal analytics to improve our Apps.</p>
<p>We also use your Information to permit certain functionalities available within the apps (such as in-app purchases), permit you to use the Game Center Features, the Social Features and the features which are available while using the "Log in with Facebook" feature as well as send you push notifications to your device. We will only use local notifications to remind you about your activities within the App.</p>
<p>In order to offer some of our Apps for free, we need to use the Information to display advertisements (banners, interstitials) with the help of our Advertising Providers. The Apps include third parties&rsquo; SDK&rsquo;s to collect the Information needed to display advertisements. The Information is used for ad serving features such as frequency capping (so that you are not displayed with the same ad twice etc.) and ad mediation. The Information may be stored on the user&rsquo;s device through generally accepted industry technologies used within our apps (such as cookies, local storage). Our Advertising Providers may use cookies and other web-tracking technologies to collect Non-personal Information in case the user clicks on any of their advertisements. Furthermore, Baby Lisi Games may advertise other Baby Lisi Games apps within its apps.</p>
<p>Our Advertising Providers are allowed to use the Information to provide contextual advertisements, conduct ad mediation, for support for internal operations and on an anonymized basis to improve their products by conducting research and analysis with the use of aggregated advertising information to understand and optimize how the advertisements are used.</p>
<p>Some of our Apps include age gate feature. For the users that identify themselves as over the age of 13 years old and have not opted out of behavioral advertising, we allow our Advertisers to supply ads with personalized content, information and feature that are on interest to you, which also includes profiling. For this users alone Advertisers might collect more Information, such as the activities of the user in our Apps for profiling purposes and behavioral advertising. You may opt out of such profiling and behavioral advertising at any time by following the instructions in the Opt Out Section of this Privacy Policy or the Behavioral Ads Disclaimer at the top of this Privacy Policy (will be added once we start offering behavioral ads and age gate as a precondition).</p>
<p>We select Advertising Providers attentively to maintain compliance with applicable privacy laws hence we only allow the display of contextual advertisements to Apps that are child directed or mixed audience. Furthermore, we flag persistent identifiers used in child directed or mixed audience apps in order to ensure our Advertising Providers are able to comply with child protection legislation namely COPPA restrictions in the US territory, meaning they are allowed to use Personal Information solely for the purposes of internal operations and contextual advertising but are prohibited from contacting a user, including through behavioral advertising; to amass a profile on a user; or use the Information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics to collect the Information in order to analyze and improve our Apps. If you are using one of our child directed Apps or mixed audience Apps and you identified yourself as under the age of 13, the collected Information will only be used for support for internal operations namely to maintain or analyze the functioning of the App, perform network communications, authenticate users in, or personalize the content in the App, protect the security or integrity of the user or App and ensure legal or regulatory compliance. We collect local notification tokens in order for us to be able to determine whether you are subscribed to push notifications. When you decide to unsubscribe from local notifications, such local notification tokens will be deleted from our database.</p>
<p>SHARING OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to disclose the Information for other lawful purposes, as customary for all App developers.</p>
<p>Apart from sharing the Information with our Analytics and Advertising Providers (together with Third Party Services Providers as defined in Section &lsquo;&rsquo;Our Providers&rsquo;&rsquo; referred to as the &lsquo;&rsquo;Providers&rsquo;&rsquo;) as stated in Section &lsquo;&rsquo;Usage of Information&rsquo;&rsquo; we may also disclose Information in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>if required by law, for example to comply with a court order, subpoena, regulation, legal process or other governmental request;</li>
<li>to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company, our users or others;</li>
<li>to enforce this privacy statement, including investigation of potential violations thereof;</li>
<li>upon fulfilling legal requirements of local legislation (for example verifiable parental consent of a legal guardian for child directed apps in the US etc.) in order to supply certain services/information third party might legally request from us</li>
<li>to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;</li>
<li>if Bubadu is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified of any change in ownership or uses of your information via our website;</li>
<li>to respond to claims that any content published on the Bubadu Apps violates any right of a third party</li>
</ul>
