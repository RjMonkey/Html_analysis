Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos.</p>\n<p><em>Actions you take.</em>\u00a0 We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services.

Payments are processed by third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe and PayPal), so please refer to the applicable processor\u2019s terms and privacy policy for more information about how payment information is processed and stored.</p>\n<p><em>Other information.</em>\u00a0 You may choose to provide other information directly to us.

This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, hardware settings, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.</p>\n<p><em>Information collected from cookies and similar technologies.</em>\u00a0 We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see \u201cYour Choices\u201d below.</p>\n<p><em>Location information.</em>\u00a0 We may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address.</p>\n</div>\n<strong class=\"h4\">Information Collected from Other Sources</strong>\n<div class=\"text no-counter\">\n<p>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers, and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences <a href=\"https://reddit.com/personalization\">here</a>.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Linked services.</em>\u00a0 If you authorize or link other services (e.g., third-party apps or websites) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see \u201cHow Information About You Is Shared\u201d below.</p>\n<p><em>Information collected from integrations.</em>\u00a0 We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party websites that integrate our Services, including our embeds, buttons, and advertising technology.

Reddit allows other websites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and via other similar technologies. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator\u2019s option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.</li></ul><ul><li>When you send private messages, messages via modmail, or private chats, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content of your message, your username, and the date and time the message was sent. Keep in mind that additional users may be invited to join a private chat after you send a message. Moderators may elect to have modmail forwarded to their email accounts and, as a result, any modmail received by these moderators will be subject to the terms and policies of the moderator\u2019s email provider.</li></ul><ul><li>When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Gold status, and how long you have been a member of the Services.

Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/privacy\">Tumblr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/\">Facebook</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/privacy\">Twitter</a>).</li></ul><p>Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers.

These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example:</p>\n</div>\n<strong class=\"h4\">Advertisers and Ad Networks</strong>\n<div class=\"text no-counter\">\n<p>Our ad partners and ad networks may use cookies and related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Reddit does not link to or provide them with your actual Reddit account details. This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Reddit cannot see advertisers\u2019 cookies and advertisers will not see Reddit cookies.\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n<strong class=\"h4\">Analytics Partners</strong>\n<div class=\"text no-counter\">\n<p>We use analytics partners (such as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/\">Google Analytics</a>) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services.
