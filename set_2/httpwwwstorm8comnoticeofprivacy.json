We store and process information in the United States.</p>\n"], ["<p><em>Personal Information and Non-Personal Information</em></p>", "\n<p>Storm8 may collect personal and non-personal information from you when you use the Service.

You can register for an Account via a Storm8 application. Certain of Your Information, such as your username and other information, may always be publicly visible by other users of the Forums, including when such users view your Account profile page. Your email address will not be publicly visible unless you choose to make it visible in your Account profile page. When you register for an Account or later access your Account, you may be able to adjust settings and preferences within your Account to choose whether to share and make publicly visible other pieces of Your Information, and the Service may display Your Information based on the settings and preferences you choose. We encourage you to consider carefully what information to share as part of your Account profile and elsewhere in the Service, and we recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and not use your real name as your username, as that may allow other users of the Service to identify you. Any information you choose to share should reflect how much you want other users of the Service to know about you. You can review and revise your Account profile information at any time.</p>\n<p>We may also request and collect Your Information when you administer or personalize your Account after registration or otherwise interact with the Service. For example, we may collect Your Information both when you enter promotions on or in connection with the Service as well as in connection with your transactions (such as, but not limited to, donations or the purchase of products) through the Service or with Storm8\u2019s advertisers. Such transaction-related information may include payment information, such as information regarding your account with an online payment service provider, and information about your use of products and services offered by our advertisers.</p>\n"], ["<p><em>Use of Applications</em></p>", "\n<p>When you launch any of our applications, we collect information regarding your device type, operating system and version, carrier provider, IP address, Media Access Control (MAC) address, International Equipment Mobile ID (IMEI), whether you are using a point package, the game version, the device\u2019s geo-location, language settings, and unique device ID. In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our Service. This unique user ID is stored in connection with your Account profile information to enable us to move Your Information to a new device at your request. In addition, it may be used to link a character with which you play our games to your username on the Forums.

For example, when you visit or request a web page from our server, we may record the IP address of the user\u2019s machine, the time, date and URL of the request and information about the browser being used, and other information regarding the visit, such as the pages visited on the Service, the time spent on each page, any advertisements clicked and any search terms used (collectively, \u201cLog Data\u201d). Log Data may be aggregated and used to monitor and analyze use of the Service and to enable us to analyze traffic and trends, administer and improve the Service, identify and keep track of errors and bugs, and gather broad demographic information to become more familiar with where visits to the Service originate, how often the Service is visited and what parts of the Service are visited most often. We may also share such information with third party service providers assisting us with the foregoing and with our advertisers. For example, some of this information may be collected and used so that when you visit the Service again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We may link Log Data to Your Information for tracking and analyzing our customers\u2019 use of the Service to help improve the Service, to tailor the Service to their needs and to enforce the Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer\u2019s hard drive.

We do not use cookies to collect personal information. However, we may combine information collected through the use of cookies we issue with personal information that you provide to us. Storm8 may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Service, and to improve the Service and our other products and services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Service. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions.

These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>\n<p>You can instruct your web browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If your browser is set to refuse all cookies, however, some features of the Forums may not function properly.</p>\n<p>We and third party advertising companies may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons or \u201cgifs\u201d, are electronic images that may be used on our Site, in our Service or in our emails. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
