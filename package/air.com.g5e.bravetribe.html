<p><strong>Malware/Spyware/Viruses:</strong> Neither G5 nor the Site and/or the Games knowingly permit the use of malware, spyware, viruses, and/or other similar types of software.</p>
<p><strong>Links to External Sites:</strong> G5 is not responsible for the content or practices of third party Web sites that may be linked to the Site and/or the Games. G5 is also not responsible for any information that you might share with such linked Web sites. You should refer to each such Web site’s respective privacy policy and practices prior to disclosing any such information.</p>
<p><strong>Bulletin Boards and Chat Areas:</strong> Guests of the Site and/or the Games are solely responsible for the content of messages they post on public forums, such as chat rooms and bulletin boards. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.</p>
<p><strong>Security/How Your Personally Identifiable Information Is Protected: </strong>Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to attempt to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and improper use. We also protect your personally identifiable information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. We continually review all such measures and update them when appropriate. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, G5 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit via the internet. By transmitting any such information to G5, you accept that you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out: </strong>The Site and/or the Games may provide you the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications from us at the point where we request information about you. You always have the option of removing your name from any e-mail list in order to discontinue any such future communications. In order to ensure immediate removal from any list, please follow the specific instructions set forth within the communications you receive from G5 which you no longer wish to receive. If you are unsuccessful in completing the instructions specified in any such communication, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@g5e.com">privacy@g5e.com</a>, including a copy of the undesired email attached to the request, and state you wish to be removed from the mailing list.</p>
<p><strong>Your Access to and Control Over Your Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>At any time, but only once per calendar year, or as otherwise required under applicable law, users may contact G5 to review the personally identifiable information that G5 has collected about you. If you discover any errors, please notify G5 and the information will be corrected.
