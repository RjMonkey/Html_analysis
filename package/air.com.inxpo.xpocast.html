Policy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”)
describes how INXPO, Inc. (either “INXPO,” “we,” or “us”) treats personal
information when you, the user, access the INXPO platform, mobile application
or website (“INXPO Website” or “Website”). This Privacy Policy only applies to
information collected by INXPO, and does not apply to any information collected
by any third party. By visiting the INXPO Website you agree to the terms of
this Privacy Policy, as they may be amended from time to time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The United States Department of
Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection
principles (the &quot;Safe Harbor Principles&quot;) to enable U.S. Companies to
satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be
given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. INXPO adheres to Safe Harbor Principles and applies those principles to any transfer
of information between the European Union countries and INXPO. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A. Cookies Policy </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>1. <u><span style='letter-spacing:
-.1pt'>What is a Cookie</span></u><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>?  A
cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that
is placed on your computer or on your mobile phone (collectively referred to
herein as a &quot;device&quot;) browser from a website's computer and is stored
on your device's hard drive.  There are two different types of cookies: session
cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies are held temporarily and
disappear when you close your browser.  Persistent cookies may be used by your
browser on subsequent visits.  Cookies are widely used to provide certain
features of website, to make websites perform more efficiently, and to provide
information to the owners of the website.  Each INXPO event and/or webcast can
send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. 
INXPO does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about
you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>2. <u>What is a Local Shared
Object (Flash Cookie)</u>?  INXPO uses both the Adobe Flash Player and
Silverlight players to deliver its video content services.  To improve user
experience, Local Shared Objects (otherwise known as Flash or Silverlight
Cookies or LSOs) are used to provide features such as auto-resume and for
saving your preferences.  Flash and Silverlight Cookies are stored on a user's
terminal much the same as cookies are, however it is not possible to manage
them at browser level in the same way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>3. <u>How to Disable Flash
Cookies</u>.  The Adobe website provides comprehensive information on how to
delete or disable Flash cookies either for a specific domain like bbc.co.uk or
for all websites.  See http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security for
more information.  Please be aware that restricting the use of Flash cookies
may affect the features available to you for Flash-based applications on the
Website and within INXPO events and presentations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>4. <u>How to Disable Silverlight
Cookies</u>.  The Microsoft Silverlight website provides directions on how to
remove Silverlight cookies.  See
http://www.ehow.com/how_5972751_remove-silverlight-cookies.html for more
information.  Please be aware that restricting the use of Silverlight cookies
may affect the features available to you for Silverlight-based applications on
the Website and within INXPO events and presentations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>5. <u>How to Control and Delete
Cookies</u>.  For events and webcasts, cookies record information about your
online preferences and allow us to present content to your interests.  Users
have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them
when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time.  If you do not
opt in to receiving cookies and/or set your device to not receive cookies,
certain personalised features cannot be provided to you, and accordingly you
may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Website's features.  Each
browser is different, so check the &quot;Help&quot; menu of your browser to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>6. <u>INXPO Cookies</u>.  In some
cases, INXPO may use cookies, Flash and Silverlight Cookies, clear gifs, and
log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to
reenter it during your visit or the next time you visit the event; (b) provide
customer, personalized content and information; or (c) monitor aggregate
