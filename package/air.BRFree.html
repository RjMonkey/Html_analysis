connection with requesting various products or services. When you make a 
purchase or sign up for a paid service, we will also collect additional Personal

cookies.&quot; Browser cookies (also called &quot;HTTP cookies&quot;) are pieces of information 
that are sent by websites and stored in your computer's hard drive, which 
provide you a service by allowing us to recognize your computer to save you from 
having to re-enter the same data every time you visit our websites. They also 
allow us and our affiliates and advertising partners to learn how visitors use 
our websites. This user data is aggregated for tracking purposes primarily by 
tallying pages viewed throughout our websites and logging Internet Protocol 
(&quot;IP&quot;) addresses, browser types, general geographic origin of access to our 
websites and similar usage data. Flash cookies (also called &quot;Locally Shared 
Objects&quot; or &quot;LSOs&quot;) are also used to remember settings and preferences and to 
track usage. However, Flash cookies are stored differently on your hard drive 
and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web 
browser. In general, Flash cookies are more persistent and can store more data 
that browser cookies.</span></font></p>

providing you the products and services you want; administering or enforcing 
transactions you have requested; protecting your accounts from fraud, 
unauthorized access, or identity theft; verifying your identity in connection 
with transactions you have requested; and managing our business and protecting 
our interests. </span></font></p>

necessary or appropriate for them to perform their services to us. In that

we transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, such as bankruptcy,

commercially reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee uses
