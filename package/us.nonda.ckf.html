When you do so, we may collect certain personal information made available through your social network account. By associating a social network account with our Services, you agree that we may access and retain that information in accordance with the policies of the social network or other online service and this Privacy Notice. For example, we may be able to access account or profile information that you have provided to the social network or information about your interactions with the social network (such as content viewed by you, content liked by you and information about the advertisements you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.).

<p><span>The Services use the following cookies:</span></p>
<p><span>Cookies are small text files that our Services ask to place on your computer’s hard drive and onto your mobile device’s memory. If your browser is set to accept cookies, then your browser adds the text in a small file.</span></p>
<p><span> We use cookie technology for various purposes, such as to facilitate your use of our Services, e.g., to remember you when you return to our Website, identify you when you sign in, authenticate your access, enable your use of specific functionalities, keep track of your specified preferences or choices, tailor content to your preferences or geographic region, display personalized browsing history, or provide technical support. </span></p>
<p><span>We may further use cookies to monitor site usage, conduct research and diagnostics to improve our content, products, and services, and to help us analyze web traffic in general.</span></p>
<p><span>Cookies also enable us to display interest-based advertising on our Website using information you make available to us when you interact with our sites, content, or services. Interest-based ads are displayed to you based on cookies linked to your online activities. </span></p>
<p><span>Our cookies expire after they have fulfilled their purpose. Our Services use cookies that expire when you close your browser (i.e., session cookies) or that expire after a set period of time (i.e., persistent cookies). Cookies that are placed by third parties will have their expiration period determined by the third party, not us.  </span></p>
<p><span>You can decide whether or not to accept cookies. The “Help” feature on most browsers will explain how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of many of our online features and functionalities, consider leaving them turned on.  </span></p>
<p><span>While our Website and nonda App at this time do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as “do not track” instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies through your web browser, as indicated above.  </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Integration of third party web analysis services and social functionalities</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Our Services integrate the following services of third parties which may also place cookies on your computer’s hard drive and/or your mobile device’s memory. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. </span></p>
<p><span> You can change your settings to refuse these third party cookies or to warn you before cookies are placed. However, if you choose not to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of some of our features and services through our Services. </span></p>
<p><span>The third parties service includes but not limited to: </span></p>
<ul>

Many analytics services allow you to opt out of data collection.  For example, to learn more about Google Analytics practices and to opt out, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">www.google.com/settings/ads</a> or by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. </span></p>

<p><span>You may withdraw your consent to collect, use, and/or disclose your personal information held or controlled by us by submitting a request. Based on the extent to which you withdraw your consent to let us process your personal information, this may mean that you will not be able to access our products and services. Deleting your account will not of itself entirely remove associated content from our systems. We will delete relevant information that can be clearly identified (like your email, name, and country), but information that cannot be clearly identified (such as your birthday or gender information) will not be deleted. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What do we use your information for? </strong></span></p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span>Privacy of Children</span></strong></p>
<p><span> The Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors.  Consistent with the requirements of applicable law, if we learn that we have received any information directly from a minor without his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) to inform the minor that he or she cannot use the Services and subsequently will delete that information.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a minor under the age of 16 (according to the legal requirements of EU member states, the minimum must not be less than 13 years old), you must obtain written consent from your parent or legal guardian before using this product and its relevant services. This product and the relevant services will protect the personal information of minors in accordance with the relevant EU laws and regulations.</span></p>

We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public. </span></p>

Likewise, we collect location information about other users’ nonda Device(s) tracked and transmitted to us by the nonda App on your mobile device, when the nonda App is activated on your mobile device.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Personal information from other sources</span></strong></p>
<p>In order to improve the Services, we sometimes need to process data further, beyond normal collection procedures. If we use your personal information beyond the stated purpose of collection, we will inform you and obtain your express consent before use.</p>
<p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment Gateway Providers Database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, who are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.</p>
<p><strong>How can you manage or delete information about you?</strong></p>
<p>We provide users with the ability to manage, change or delete their data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing your email, nickname, and more: You can review and change your personal information by logging into your account and visiting your account settings page.</li>
<li>Unsubscribe：If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscription instructions at the bottom of each email. You may also unsubscribe by visiting your account settings page.</li>
<li>Deleting your account: If you want to delete your Account, we will enable you to do this in your account settings page. Deleting your Account will entirely remove the content you have published from our systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note：Our website only collects your personal information when you register on our site, place an order or subscribe to our newsletter</p>
<p><strong>How long will the data be stored?</strong></p>
<p>We store the data until we no longer need it to provide services or until the user's account is deleted, depending on which comes first. This requires specific analysis of the situation and depends on the nature of the data, the reasons for collecting and processing the data, and the related legal or operational retention needs.</p>
<p><strong>Do we collect information that was created by automated means？</strong></p>
<p>Usually we do not collect automated information.</p>
<p><strong>Do we send you promotional information?</strong></p>
<p>Occasionally, we may need to email you if you subscribe. We may need to send you some products information and tell you something important campaign. But if you do not subscribe, we will not send you any promotional related information.</p>
<p><strong>Do we get information from other sources?</strong></p>
<p>You can login to our website with your Facebook or Google account. We will obtain Information from the Facebook account or Google account you use to login to the website, such as your name, email, gender, birthday, picture (your Facebook password is collected directly by Facebook without passing through our systems, and we do not have access to it). Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone, you should exercise care in what you choose to submit; make sure everything you submit is something you want to share with everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</strong></p>
