In other words, for you to be able to register as a Customer or order our materials as a User, we must process your Personal Data because otherwise we would be unable to provide you with the Service (necessity for contract performance or service provision).</p>

    <p>We process data for purposes connected with ClickMeeting’s legitimate interests, depending on the types of ties between us and our Customers or Users.</p>
    <p><strong>What data do we use and what for?</strong></p>

We understand that the processing of such data is beneficial for everyone, and in particular for you and your clients, because it helps us establish the measures to protect your and your recipients against transmission of malware, attempts to disrupt your Conferences or fraud attempts by third parties.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Sending marketing and promotional communications</h3>
    <p>We use your Personal Data for those purposes based on the consent you have expressly granted.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Registration data, i.e. first name/business name and e-mail address</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4. Marketing purposes, including the development of your customer profile</h3>
    <p>We want our Service and Website, including the communications addressed to you, such as marketing communications, to match your needs and preferences as much as possible (profiling). Below we describe what this is about.</p>
    <p><strong>What data do we use and what for?</strong></p>
    <p>In order to develop the sales and marketing of our Service, and to create Customer or User profile matching your interests and preferences, we process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Registration data, i.e. first name/business name, e-mail address, address.</li>
        <li>Data specified in Account details.</li>
        <li>Data generated automatically in connection with your activity on the Website or in the Service (described more broadly in II.3. of the Privacy Policy).</li>
        <li>Data collected through cookies and tracking technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have agreed as a User to receive marketing communications from us or established a business relationship with us by subscribing to the Service we will adapt advertising and marketing content regarding our Services to the profile. We will not send you any communications regarding the products or services of other entities.</p>
    <p>We believe that we have a legitimate interest in analysing how our Services and Website are used by the Customers and Users so that we can improve them and help increase the number of Customers and Users who use them.</p>
    <p>Website Users who wish to receive marketing communications to the specified e-mail actions act based on voluntary, conscious and definite consent so we believe that they can reasonably expect us to send such communications; similarly, our Customers, who ordered the Service, can reasonably expect to receive news and other marketing communication pertaining to our Service. These people also expect the communications they receive to match their interests. Adapted marketing communications addressed to Customers let them use beneficial special offers and allow them to make an optimum use of our Service.</p>
    <p>At the same time, we do the profiling only based on the data provided by them or data regarding their activity within the Service or Website. We are interested only in information related to your use of the Service or Website and not what you do on other websites.</p>
    <p>As a result, we believe that our interest is legitimate, lawful and free of violations of any overriding User or Customer rights.</p>

<div id="GroupASub4" class="subgroup">
    <h2>IV. Who we disclose your data to</h2>
    <h3>1. Data transfer within the Service</h3>
    <p><strong>Profile Page</strong> – the data on your profile page are fully visible outside the Service area (e.g. to users of third party search engines). We believe that default settings where the profile page is public are expected and beneficial for you, your Participants and invitees because this helps you promote your activity and planned Conferences online and the concerned parties to obtain the required information about you and your planned public events. You may decide about the availability of your profile website at any time and about the visibility of some of its parts through your Account settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Conferences</strong> - if you participate in a Conference organised through the Service, your first and last name, if you provided it during registration for the event, as well as any information you provide during the Conference chat may be visible to other Participants of the event. Additionally, if the Conference presenter gives you an audio or video transmission authorisation, your voice or image will be shared with other Participants of that Conference.</p>
    <p><strong>Integrations</strong> - if you integrate your Service Account with services of other providers, the content and data you have uploaded to your Account may be shared with such providers or downloaded from such services. For instance, you may integrate your Account with your CRM account to automatically export there your list of Participants from Conference or integrate with your mailbox account and import your address book to you Account to use to send invitations to an event you organise through the Service.</p>

    <h3>2. Other data recipients</h3>
    <p>We transfer your data to the following categories of recipients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Processors.</strong> We use providers who process your Personal Data only at our instruction, as processors acting on our behalf. They provide services covering certain functionalities of the Service (sending e-mails), hosting services, Customer service support and services connected with security incident tracing and response, troubleshooting and problem solving in the Service or on the Website, for the purpose of Website traffic analysis and analysis of the success of marketing campaigns.</li>
        <li><strong>Other controllers.</strong> We work with entities who do not act exclusively on our instructions and who independently establish the purpose and methods of processing your Personal Data. We use the services of such third parties (controllers) to reach you with our marketing communications outside the Website. Their services involve presenting our marketing communications to you on websites other than the Website. To that end, the third-party controllers install e.g. a code or pixel to collect information about your activity within the Website. You will learn more about this in Chapter V of this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Public authority.</strong> We provide your Personal Data if requested by authorised public authorities in connection with their legal obligation to perform a public function. We provide the data exclusively at a written request of the authority filed on a case-by-case basis.</li>
        <li><strong>ClickMeeting affiliates.</strong> We provide your Personal Data to GetResponse Sp. z o.o., a company with personal ties to ClickMeeting, to efficiently provide Services to Customers.</li>
    </ul>

We also allow specific providers to collect data from your browser for advertising and measurement purposes using cookies or similar technologies.</p>
    
    <h3>3. To which countries are my data transferred?</h3>

Depending on the provider, these guarantees arise from:</p>

    <h2>VI. Your rights. You have control over your data</h2>
    <h3>1. General Information</h3>
    <p>We make sure that our Customers and Users can exercise their rights concerning their data.</p>
    <p>You may exercise your rights by submitting your request through the contact form or to the following email address <a href="mailto:privacy@clickmeeting.com">privacy@clickmeeting.com</a>.  All you need to do is to inform us about the reason behind your request and specify the right you want to exercise.</p>
    <p>If you have an Account in the Service, you can exercise some of your rights directly in Privacy Settings after you log in to your Account. Please remember that if you change your Privacy Settings, it may take us a little time to apply your changes in our systems for technical reasons. That’s why during this time our system may for example still send you an email message you have unsubscribed from while your settings are being updated.</p>
    <p>If we decide this is necessary for identification purposes, we may ask you some additional questions or ask you to provide us with additional documents to confirm your identity.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Right to give and withdraw your consent</h3>
    <p>If we ask for consent, you can always choose whether to give it or not. In addition, you may withdraw any consent you have granted while creating an Account or using the Website at any time. This also applies to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to the processing of your e-mail address so that we can send you marketing communications by electronic means to that e-mail address,</li>
        <li>to the collection of your data through cookies. More about this in <a data-sidebar="scroll" href="#GroupASub5">Chapter V</a> of the Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consent withdrawal is effective as of the moment of withdrew it. Your withdrawal does not affect any prior processing of your data. Consent withdrawal does not have any negative consequences for you. Still, you may become unable to further use some functionalities of the Service or Website which the law only allows us to provide if we have your consent (e.g. the newsletter).</p>
    <p>You can withdraw your consent using a few simple methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>in the Privacy Settings in your Customer Account</li>
        <li>by clicking “unsubscribe” in the message you have received</li>
        <li>for consent to cookies – in your browser settings</li>
        <li>as described in Chapter I of this Privacy Policy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We treat withdrawal of your consent to marketing communication as your objection to profiling for marketing purposes.</p>

    <h3>3. Right of access</h3>
    <p>You have the right to receive information on whether or not we process your Personal Data from us. If we do, you have the right to receive:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>information about the rules according to which we process your Personal Data,</li>
        <li>access to your Personal Data,</li>
        <li>a copy of your Personal Data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have your Account in the Service, you are able to obtain direct access to the majority of your Personal Data at any time after logging in the Account.</p>
    <p>We will not charge you for the first copy of your data. For any other requests for copies of data, we may charge a fee corresponding to the administrative costs connected with preparing that information.</p>

    <h3>4. Right to rectification</h3>
    <p>You have the right to demand correcting and completing Personal Data you have provided. You may do this on your own in Privacy Settings in your Account. In respect of other Personal Data, you have the right to request that we rectify them (if they are incorrect) or supplement them (if they are incomplete).</p>

    <h3>5. Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)</h3>
    <p>In the cases specified by the law, you have the right to request that we erase the Personal Data that concern you. We will treat a request to erase all Personal Data as a request to delete your Account.</p>
    <p>You have the right to request Personal Data erasure if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the data processing violates the law or if we have to erase the data to satisfy a legal obligation,</li>
        <li>your Personal Data are no longer required for the purposes for which they were processed,</li>
        <li>you withdrew your consent to Personal Data processing (insofar as the consent represented a legal ground for the processing),</li>
        <li>you have objected to the processing of your Personal Data for marketing purposes,</li>
        <li>you have objected to the processing of your Personal Data for the purpose of statistics regarding Service or Website use and satisfaction research, and the objection was considered justified.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will retain some of your Personal Data despite your request to erase them if this is required for us to satisfy a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of claim. This applies in particular to such Personal Data as: first name, last name, e-mail address, history of using the Service or Website; we retain this data for the purpose of examination of any complaints and claims connected with the use of the Service or Website.</p>

    <h3>6. Right to restriction of processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request restriction of the processing of your Personal Data. If you make such a request, you will be unable to use certain functionalities of the Service or Website until your request is considered is the use of such functionalities will entail the processing of the data covered by the request. We will not send you any communications, including marketing communications, either.</p>
    <p>You have the right to request restriction of the use of your Personal Data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you question the correctness of your Personal Data – we will then limit their use for the time required to check the correctness of your data but not for more than 30 days,</li>
        <li>If the processing of your data is unlawful, and you request restriction of processing instead of data erasure,</li>
        <li>When your Personal Data are not longer required for the purposes for which we have collected or used them but you need them to establish, exercise or defend claims.</li>
        <li>If you have objected to the use of your Personal Data – the restriction then takes place for the time required to determine whether, due to your particular situation, the protection of your interests, rights and freedoms overrides the interests we pursue by processing your Personal Data.</li>
    </ul>	

    <h3>7. Right to object to data processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to object to the use of your Personal Data if we process your Personal Data based on our legitimate interests. We have already described such cases above in Chapter III of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>In particular, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, which include creating your customer profile. In such a case, we will not longer process your data for that purpose and we will no longer send you marketing information.</p>
    <p>Additionally, withdrawal of the consent to the marketing communications regarding our Services will mean your objection to the processing of your data for direct marketing purposes, including for the development of your customer profile.</p>
    <p>In relation to the processing described in section III.2 of the Privacy Policy, if your objection turns out to be justified and we will have no other legal ground to process your Personal Data, we will delete the data to the processing of which you objected.</p>

    <h3>8. Right to data portability</h3>
    <p>If you have created an Account with us or agreed to the processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to receive the Personal Data that concern you which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperational format that permits sending them to another controller. We will send you your Personal Data in the form of a csv file. The csv format is a commonly used, machine-readable format that permits sending the received Personal Data to another controller.</p>
    <p>If technically feasible, you have the right to request that we send your Personal Data directly to anther controller. Just remember that controllers are not legally obligated to keep technically compatible processing systems.</p>

    <h3>9. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h3>
    <p>Please be informed that you have the right to complain about the processing of your Personal Data to a supervisory authority; in Poland this is the President of the Personal Data Protection Office, contact details: ul. Stawki 2, 00-193 Warsaw, Poland.</p>

</div>

<div id="GroupDSub5" class="subgroup">
    <h3>V. Affiliate Commissions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The Affiliate will receive a Commission for each complete purchase of the Service made in the Agreement term by the customer referred by the Affiliate. This means that the Affiliate will receive the Commission upon accepted payment if the customer was referred through the Affiliate’s referral link and the customer's software allowed Company to save such a referral cookie. The Affiliate is not entitled to the Commission for the purchases of the Service through their own referral link - this means that the Affiliate will not receive the Commission for the purchase of the Service made by the Affiliate himself/herself, their corporation, employer or the like or any other entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Affiliate.  This includes also any purchases made not under Affiliate’s name but with the use of Affiliate’s payment medium (e.g. credit card, check, bank account)</li>
        <li>If a new customer referred by the Affiliate purchases the Service, the Affiliate will receive a residual Commission calculated as a percentage of the amount paid to the Company for the Service by the referred customer. In such case the Commission rate is 30%.</li>
        <li>Where the customer referred by the Affiliate has paid for the Service in other currency than the one used for settlement purposes with the Affiliate, we will convert and credit the associated Commission in the relevant currency using the published Wall Street Journal index at the time of payment.</li>
        <li>A summary of purchases of the Service and statement of referral Commission is available to the Affiliate by logging into their Affiliate account.</li>
        <li>The Company reserves the right to grant discount for the Service to chosen customers. Commissions reflect a percentage, not a particular amount, therefore it is possible that the Commission on the sale of the same Service may be different every month. </li>
        <li>Commissions are calculated on the last day of each month and are paid out only when the accrued Commissions exceed either USD 50, EUR 50, GBP 50 or PLN 150 (depending on the Affiliate’s domicile/residence). If on the last day of the month the balance owing in the account is less than the aforesaid limit, the Commission will be accumulated in the account. Commissions are credited to your Affiliate account once the customer pays for the Service. Commissions are only earned if a customer makes a payment in full. </li>
        <li>Accrued Commissions are paid in the form of USD check, ACH, Eurotransfer or via other payment method if agreed individually with the Company. Affiliate checks are mailed via regular mail to the address provided upon registration, on or around the 20th of every subsequent month. The Commission paid by ACH and Eurotransfer is effected on the same date as in case of checks.</li>
        <li>Based on internal risk analysis, the Company reserves the right to withhold first time payments and any other payments originating from an account where there is suspected fraud activity - for a period of up to 3 months and in cases the Affiliate violates any of the provisions of these Terms – all Commissions accrued and not paid out for as long as the Affiliate is in breach. The Company reserves also the right to disqualify Commissions earned through fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods.</li>
        <li>To ensure proper Commission payment, the Affiliate is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact details including address, as well as payment information associated with the Affiliate’s account. If you are a US taxpayer, you should include without limitation a valid tax identification number and Form W-9. If you are a non-US taxpayer, you should provide the Company without limitation with either a signed certification that you do not have US Activities, or a completed Form W-8 or other form, which may require a valid US tax identification number, as required by the US tax authorities. No Commission payment shall be made unless the Affiliate provides the Company with accurate and complete contact and tax details.</li>
        <li>The Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that all the sums of Commissions payable under the Program are calculated jointly for the purpose of fulfillment of tax obligations. </li>
        <li>The Company reserves the right to change the Commission rate and Service prices at any time. Any Commissions accrued after such a change will be at the new rate.  </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div id="GroupDSub6" class="subgroup">
    <h3>VI. Refunds/Chargebacks/Fraud </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Any customer refunds, reversals or credit card chargebacks owed by the Company to the referred customer will result in the appropriate Commission amount being deducted from the Affiliate's account balance <strong>("Deducted Commission")</strong>. If the Commission from that sale has already been paid to the Affiliate, the amount will be deducted from future payments of the Commissions. If the Commission owed to the Affiliate in the next month is not sufficient to satisfy the Deducted Commission, GetResponse may invoicethe Affiliate will be invoiced for the payment of the remaining debt immediately and the Affiliate is obligated to pay it within the payment date provided in the invoice.</li>
        <li>The Company reserves the right to terminate the Agreement with immediate effect in the event of not receiving the remaining debt within the payment date provided in the invoice referred to in s. 1 above. </li>
        <li>Any fraudulent activity that can be traced directly to the Affiliate's actions will cause immediate termination and forfeiture of any Commission earned.</li>
        <li>If an account of customer referred by Affiliate is terminated due to practices or actions that GetResponse considers to be abusive, prohibited or that violate GetResponse Terms of Service in other ways, GetResponse reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to withhold or forfeit one or all Commissions earned (regardless of whether paid or outstanding) for referring the terminated customer. If the number of terminated customer accounts referred by Affiliate is abnormal or GetResponse may reasonably suspect that it is a part of fraudulent activity, GetResponse shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to forfeit not only Commissions earned for referring terminated customers, but all Commissions earned (regardless of whether paid or outstanding) by Affiliate during the term of Agreement. As regards settlement rules section 1 and 2 above shall apply accordingly, i.e. GetResponse is entitled in particular to deduct relevant amounts of forfeited Commissions from future payments due to Affiliate and if the Commission owed in the next month is not sufficient, GetResponse may invoice the Affiliate for payment of remaining debt.</li>

We will notify you as soon as reasonably practical of any such claim, demand or cause of action for which we will require indemnification from you.</li>

        <li>The Company shall not be responsible for any intermediary charges, transaction fees and other costs or expenses accrued by the Affiliate in connection with the Program.</li>

We reserve the right to refuse to undertake additional actions regarding payment, in particular to refuse to issue another check, if you submit a relevant request after 12 months as of making payment, e.g. issuing check, or if you failed to inform us about problems with payment within the above period, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect a fraudulent activity.</li>
