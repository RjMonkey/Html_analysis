    <strong><em>TRANSPORTATION SERVICES</em></strong>
</p>
<p>

    Services, the Spesho (U) Ltd Services will provide you with certain User
    Information via the Driver App, including the User&#39;s first name and pickup
    location. In order to enhance User satisfaction with the Spesho (U) Ltd

    pick up location. You will obtain the destination from the User, either in
    person upon pickup or from the Driver App if the User elects to enter such
    destination via SPESHO&#39;s mobile application. You acknowledge and agree that

    (U) Ltd&#39;s mobile application may provide certain information about you to
    the User, including your first name, contact information, photo and
    location, and your Vehicle&#39;s make and license plate number. You shall not
    contact any Users or use any User&#39;s personal data for any reason other than

    (U) Ltd and you, you acknowledge and agree that:
</p>
<p>
    You shall be solely responsible for determining the most effective,
    efficient and safe manner to perform each instance of Transportation
    Services; and
</p>
<p>
    except for the Spesho (U) Ltd Services or any Spesho (U) Ltd Devices (if
    applicable), you shall provide all necessary equipment, tools and other
    materials, at your own expense, necessary to perform Transportation
    Services.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that your provision of Transportation Services to
    Users creates a direct business relationship between you and the User.
    Spesho (U) Ltd is not responsible or liable for the actions or inactions of
    a User in relation to you, your activities or your Vehicle. You shall have
    the sole responsibility for any obligations or liabilities to Users or
    third parties that arise from your provision of Transportation Services.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for taking such
    precautions as may be reasonable and proper (including maintaining adequate
    insurance that meets the requirements of all applicable laws) regarding any
    acts or omissions of a User or third party. You acknowledge and agree that
    Spesho (U) Ltd may release your contact and/or insurance information to a
    User upon such User&#39;s reasonable request.
</p>

    you may not transport or allow inside your Vehicle individuals other than a
    User and any individuals authorized by such User, during the performance of
    Transportation Services for such User. You acknowledge and agree that all
    Users should be transported directly to their specified destination, as
    directed by the applicable User, without unauthorized interruption or
    unauthorized stops.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>LOCATION BASED SERVICES</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that your geo location information must be
    provided to the Spesho (U) Ltd Services via a Device in order to provide
    Transportation Services.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that:
</p>
<p>
    your geo location information may be obtained by the Spesho (U) Ltd
    Services while the Driver App is running; and
</p>
<p>
    the approximate location of your Vehicle will be displayed to the User
    before and during the provision of Transportation Services to such User. In
    addition, Spesho (U) Ltd and its Affiliates may monitor, track and share
    with third parties Driver&#39;s geo location information obtained by the Driver
    App and Device for safety and security purposes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>RATING THE SERVICE OFFERED</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that:
</p>
<p>
    after receiving Transportation Services, a User will be prompted by Spesho
    (U) Ltd&#39;s mobile application to provide a rating of you and such
    Transportation Services and, optionally, to provide comments or feedback
    about you and such Transportation Services; and
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge that Spesho (U) Ltd desires that Users have access to high
    quality services via Spesho (U) Ltd&#39;s mobile application. In order to
    continue to receive access to the Driver App and the Spesho (U) Ltd
    Services, you must maintain an average rating by Users that exceeds the
    minimum average acceptable rating established by Spesho (U) Ltd for your
    Territory, as may be updated from time to time by Spesho (U) Ltd in its
    sole discretion (&quot;Minimum Average Rating&quot;).
</p>
<p>
    Your average rating is intended to reflect Users&#39; satisfaction with your
    Transportation Services rather than your compliance with any of Spesho (U)
    Ltd&#39;s policies or recommendations.
</p>
<p>
    In the event your average rating falls below the Minimum Average Rating,
    Spesho (U) Ltd will notify you and may provide you, in Spesho (U) Ltd&#39;s

</p>
<p>
    The driver is entitled to charge a fare for each instance of completed
    Transportation Services provided to a User that are obtained via the Spesho
    (U) Ltd Services (&quot;Fare&quot;), where such Fare is calculated based upon a base
    fare amount plus distance (as determined by Spesho (U) Ltd using location
    based services enabled through the Device) and/or time amounts, for the
    applicable Territory (&quot;Fare Calculation&quot;). You acknowledge and agree that
    the Fare provided under the Fare Calculation is the only payment you will
    receive in connection with the provision of Transportation Services, and
    that neither the Fare nor the Fare Calculation includes any gratuity. You
    are also entitled to charge User for any Tolls, taxes or fees incurred
    during the provision of Transportation Services, if applicable.
</p>
<p>
    You:
</p>
<p>
    appoint Spesho (U) Ltd as your limited payment collection agent solely for
    the purpose of accepting the Fare, applicable Tolls and, depending on the
    region and/or if requested by you, applicable taxes and fees from the User
    on your behalf via the payment processing functionality facilitated by the
    Spesho (U) Ltd Services; and
</p>
<p>
    agree that payment made by User to Spesho (U) Ltd (or to an Affiliate of
    Spesho (U) Ltd acting as an agent of Spesho (U) Ltd) shall be considered
    the same as payment made directly by User to you. In addition, the parties
    acknowledge and agree that as between you and Spesho (U) Ltd, the Fare is a
    recommended amount, and the primary purpose of the pre-arranged Fare is to
    act as the default amount
</p>
<p>
    .
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Changes to Fare Calculation</em></strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Spesho (U) Ltd reserves the right to change the Fare Calculation at any
    time in Spesho (U) Ltd&#39;s discretion based upon local market factors, and
    Spesho (U) Ltd will provide you with notice in the event of changes to the
    base fare, per mile, and/or per minute amounts that would result in a
    change in the recommended Fare. Continued use of the Spesho (U) Ltd
    Services after any such change in the Fare Calculation shall constitute
    your consent to such change.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Fare Adjustment</em>. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Spesho (U) Ltd reserves the right to: (i) adjust the Fare for a particular
    instance of Transportation Services (e.g., you took an inefficient route,
    you failed to properly end a particular instance of Transportation Services
    in the Driver App, technical error in the Spesho (U) Ltd Services, etc.);
    or (ii) cancel the Fare for a particular instance of Transportation
    Services (e.g., User is charged for Transportation Services that were not
    provided, in the event of a User complaint, fraud, etc.). Spesho (U) Ltd&#39;s
    decision to reduce or cancel the Fare in any such manner shall be exercised
    in a reasonable manner.

    transaction basis calculated at <strong>25 </strong>% percentage of the
    Fare determined by the Fare Calculation, as provided to you via email or
    otherwise made available electronically by Spesho (U) Ltd from time to time
    for the applicable Territory (&quot;Service Fee&quot;). In the event regulations
    applicable to your Territory require taxes to be calculated on the Fare,
    Spesho (U) Ltd shall calculate the Service Fee based on the Fare net of
    such taxes. Spesho (U) Ltd reserves the right to change the Service Fee at
    any time in Spesho (U) Ltd&#39;s discretion based upon local market factors,
    and Spesho (U) Ltd will provide you with notice in the event of such
    change. Continued use of the Spesho (U) Ltd Services after any such change
    in the Service Fee calculation shall constitute your consent to such
    change.

    accepted request for Transportation Services, Spesho (U) Ltd may charge the
    User a cancellation fee on your behalf. If charged, this cancellation fee
    shall be deemed the Fare for the cancelled Transportation Services for the
    purpose of remittance to you hereunder (&quot;Cancellation Fee&quot;).

    Transportation Services and may include specific information about you,
    including your name, contact information and photo, as well as a map of the
    route you took.

    Any corrections to a User&#39;s receipt for Transportation Services must be
    submitted to Spesho (U) Ltd in writing within three (3) business days after
    the completion of such Transportation Services. Absent such a notice,

    <strong><em>GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in
    connection with this Agreement or the Spesho (U) Ltd Services that are not
    subject to the arbitration clause contained below shall be subject to the
    exclusive jurisdiction of the Ugandan law and Courts of Law. The failure of
    Spesho (U) Ltd to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall
    not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and
    agreed to by Spesho (U) Ltd in writing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Arbitration Provision</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Important Note Regarding this Arbitration Provision:
</p>
<p>
    Except as provided below, arbitration does not limit or affect the legal
    claims you may bring against the Spesho (U) Ltd. Agreeing to arbitration
    only affects where any such claims may be brought and how they will be
    resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not
    involve the civil courts, a civil judge, or a jury. Instead, the parties&#39;
    dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties using
    the process set forth herein. Other arbitration rules and procedures are
    also set forth herein.
</p>
<p>
    Unless the law requires otherwise, as determined by the Arbitrator based
    upon the circumstances presented, you will be required to split the cost of
    any arbitration with the Spesho (U) Ltd.
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration, with the exception of proceedings that must be exhausted under
    applicable law before pursuing a claim in a court of law or in any forum
    other than arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>GENERAL.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You may not assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part without
    Spesho Uganda Limited&#39;s prior written approval. You give your approval to
    Spesho Uganda Limited for it to assign or transfer these Terms in whole or
    in part, including to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of
    Spesho Uganda Limited&#39;s equity, business or assets; or (iii) a successor by
    merger. No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship
    exists between you, Spesho Uganda Limited or any Third Party Provider as a
    result of the contract between you and Spesho Uganda Limited or use of the
    Services.
</p>
<p>
    If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or

    through your use of the Service, Spesho Uganda Limited will facilitate your
    payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as
    such Third Party Provider&#39;s limited payment collection agent. Payment of
    the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made
    directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of
    applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and
    non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Spesho Uganda Limited. You
    retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for
    services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the
    time you receive such services or goods. Spesho Uganda Limited will respond

    Charges for a particular service or good.
</p>
<p>

    Uganda Limited using the preferred payment method (whether credit card or
    mobile money) designated in your Account, after which Spesho Uganda Limited
    will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is

    agree that Spesho Uganda Limited may, as the Third Party Provider&#39;s limited
    payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account,

    Transportation Services, if applicable.
</p>
<p>
    As between you and Spesho Uganda Limited, Spesho Uganda Limited reserves
    the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all
    services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in
    Spesho Uganda Limited&#39;s sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree
    that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase
    substantially during times of high demand. Spesho Uganda Limited will use
    reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that
    you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless
    of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Spesho Uganda
    Limited may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers
    and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or
    similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you
    agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made
    available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the
    Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services
    or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party
    Provider&#39;s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.

    Provider for the services or goods provided. Except with respect to taxicab
    transportation services requested through the Application, Spesho Uganda

    to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by Spesho Uganda Limited
    (on Spesho Uganda Limited&#39;s website, in the Application, or in Spesho
    Uganda Limited&#39;s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is
    &quot;voluntary,&quot; &quot;not required,&quot; and/or &quot;included&quot; in the payments you make for
    services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Spesho Uganda
    Limited provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to
    the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free
    to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who
    provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are
    under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have
    received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the
    opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about
    your Third Party Provider.

    damages and necessary cleaning (&quot;<em>Repair or Cleaning</em>&quot;). In the
    event that a Third Party Provider reports the need for Repair or Cleaning,

    Spesho Uganda Limited&#39;s reasonable discretion, Spesho Uganda Limited
    reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such
    Repair or Cleaning on behalf of the Third Party Provider using your payment

    <strong>Arbitration Provision</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Important Note Regarding this Arbitration Provision:
</p>
<p>
    Except as provided below, arbitration does not limit or affect the legal
    claims you may bring against the Spesho (U) Ltd. Agreeing to arbitration
    only affects where any such claims may be brought and how they will be
    resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not
    involve the civil courts, a civil judge, or a jury. Instead, the parties&#39;
    dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties using
    the process set forth herein. Other arbitration rules and procedures are
    also set forth herein.
</p>
<p>
    Unless the law requires otherwise, as determined by the Arbitrator based
    upon the circumstances presented, you will be required to split the cost of
    any arbitration with the Spesho (U) Ltd.
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration, with the exception of proceedings that must be exhausted under
    applicable law before pursuing a claim in a court of law or in any forum
    other than arbitration
