While some newer browsers have incorporated \u201cDo Not Track\u201d features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy.</p></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code\" data-block-type=\"23\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527271727856_305133\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><a id=\"fourteen\" name=\"Introduction\"></a></div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527271727856_305199\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>", "level": 0}], [{"value": "<strong>14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 International Transfer</strong>", "level": 1}, {"value": "</p><p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
